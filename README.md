- Scanner (User input handling)

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Separation of concerns
- Data validation
- Modular design
- Method-driven logic
- CRUD implementation

## Project Structure
- 'Student.java' --> Model class representing student entity
- 'StudentManagement.java' --> Handles business logic and operations
- 'Main.java' --> Manages user interaction and menu system

## Purpose
This project was built to strengthen backend logic, OOP fundamentals, and structured application design before moving to larger real-world systems.
